# Introduction: 
A genetic algorithm is a problem-solving technique inspired by the principles of natural evolution. It works by simulating the process of natural selection and genetic inheritance to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex problems. The algorithm starts with a population of potential solutions, each represented as a "chromosome" encoding specific traits. 
This documentation explains how a genetic algorithm is used to find solutions to the equation 2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0. The process mimics biological evolution to search for optimal solutions.

# Problem Definition: 
1.	Equation to solve: 2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0
2.	Goal: Find values of x that make this equation true (or very close to true)

# Installation (Jupyter)
To run this project locally,follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
 Creating a virtual environment is recommended to keep project dependencies isolated.
'''sh
python -m

3. **Install Jupyter Notebook and dependencies:**
 Install Jupyter Notebook and other dependencies using pip.

4.**Start Jupyter Notebook:**
Launch Jupyter Notebook to run the genetic algorithm notebook.

5.**Open the notebook:**
Navigate to the genetic_algorithm.ipynb file in your Jupyter Notebook interface and open it to execute the genetic algorithm code.

6.**Shutdown Jupyter Notebook:**
Once finished, you can shut down Jupyter Notebook by pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal where it's running and confirming the shutdown.

7.**Deactivate virtual environment (if used):**
