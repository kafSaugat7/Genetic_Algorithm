# Introduction: 
A genetic algorithm is a problem-solving technique inspired by the principles of natural evolution. It works by simulating the process of natural selection and genetic inheritance to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex problems. The algorithm starts with a population of potential solutions, each represented as a "chromosome" encoding specific traits. 
This documentation explains how a genetic algorithm is used to find solutions to the equation 2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0. The process mimics biological evolution to search for optimal solutions.

# Problem Definition: 
1.	Equation to solve: 2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0
2.	Goal: Find values of x that make this equation true (or very close to true)
